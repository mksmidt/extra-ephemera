# About Unit Testing
 
I have learned that testing is really, truly important - you are doing yourself and others a disservice by not writing tests! It is current and future proofing. It is, in of itself, documentation.
 
 
# API Testing with Alba
 
```csharp
 
using Alba;
 
namespace HelpDesk.Tests.Software;
public class GettingSoftware
{
    // Test that we can make an HTTP GET requests to /api/software
 
    [Fact]
    public async Task CanGetSoftware()
    {
        var host = await AlbaHost.For<Program>();
 
        await host.Scenario(api =>
        {
            api.Get.Url("/api/software");
            api.StatusCodeShouldBeOk();
        });
 
 
    }
}
```
 
Write what you understand about this code. What is Alba? Where did that come from? What is `Program`?

This code entails a single test. I think that Alba is an internal place to send HTTP requests, perhaps some sort of dashboard.
Since Alba is in a using statement, it seems to be a separate software which is in the files, likely intentionally imported to test this.
The 'Program' seems like it is something that Alba is expecting to see when set up. My best guess is that Alba shows you what an HTTP request looks like and what it returns in a dashboard.


# Personal Notes

Waterfall methodology - frequently presented negatively, but still present in a lot of ways

On any software project, velocity (excitement, pace) will decrease with time. More code and more requirements means more time is spent. Typically, the harder stuff is done later.
Beginning speed is "fake," in a way, because of what is kept for later.

System tests - testing our API, not the Angular app

Unit tests - Test individual units of functionality within a system

White box tests - break encapsulation, test HOW code does things, not WHAT it does
